# webplatformer
A tiny platformer game in 42 lines of JS, with all the logic coded in CSS! In particular, some platforms are moving, some others are collapsing as soon the player is sitting on them.

Playable here: https://francoisschwarzentruber.github.io/webplatformer/

It can be used as a starting project to learn CSS.
